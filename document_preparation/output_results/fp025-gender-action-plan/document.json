This will contribute to identifying and addressing women and men sub-borrowers' differentiated needs and priorities in accessing finance for improving the uptake of climate technologies, ultimately leading to improved energy security and climate resilience for both men and women in both urban and rural areas in EBRD's Countries of Operations (CoOs).\n\n| **Output 1:** Baseline assessment to be undertaken to create an evidence-base of women and men sub-borrowers in relation to: (a) awareness of and access to information in relation to climate change risks and ways to mitigate those risks, (b) differentiated needs, priorities, vulnerabilities to climate change as well as coping strategies, including a selection of climate technologies used by men and women; and (c) obstacles to access finance for the adoption of climate technologies, for both residential and commercial use; | | | |\n\nA country-level baseline assessment will be undertaken in each of the countries that are part of the programme. The assessment will:\n• Based on secondary sources, describe country-specific climate-related problems, climate projections, adaptive capacity and available assets and services for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation;\n• Identify the differentiated vulnerabilities of men and women to climate change risks, as well as coping strategies including, but not limited to, a selection of climate technologies used by men and women in different country-relevant climatic contexts;\n• Identify and analyse modes of access to information and men and women's understanding and awareness of climate change risks and ways to mitigate those risks;\n• Identify women's barriers to access finance;\n• Identify opportunities to engage in policy dialogue activities to address issues restricting women's ability to adopt climate technologies financed under the programme, such as access to finance, lack of access to collateral etc.;\n• Present and discuss findings of the needs assessment during a multi-stakeholders workshop at the national level of each of the countries that are part of the programme.\n• Develop recommendations to improve women and women-led MSMEs' access to climate finance in the context of the programme, including in the areas of (i) outreach (marketing and awareness raising); (ii) capacity building of women-led MSEMs; (iii) adaptation of PFIs lending methodologies, delivery mechanisms and financial products to reach out women and women-led MSMEs; | • Number of country level gender assessments developed\n• Number of multi-stakeholder workshops held at the sub-national level\n• Number of participants to the multi-stakeholder workshops | On a rolling basis, as projects come through; and at project completion | EBRD Consultant with support from local stakeholders, including PFIs |\n\n| **Output 2:** Outreach activities to be organised to promote awareness of programme financing opportunities among men and women potential sub-borrowers | | | |\n\nAs part of the efforts to market the programme and improve uptake of climate finance, and using the findings of the baseline assessment as a basis, the Consultants will:\n• Deliver awareness-raising activities to men and women potential sub-borrowers about climate change risks in a given country context and the potential to mitigate those risks through access to programme finance;\n• Deliver financial literacy capacity-building activities to women entrepreneurs/potential sub-borrowers to improve their ability to access finance; | • Number of users, PFIs, retailers, government officials and other stakeholders participating in events for baseline dissemination\n• Number of men and women entrepreneurs who participated in awareness-raising activities\n• Number of women entrepreneurs who received financial literacy capacity-building activities\n• Number of PFI staff with an enhanced understanding of men and women's different vulnerabilities to and awareness of climate change risks | On a rolling basis, where applicable, as sub-projects come through | EBRD Consultant, with support from local stakeholders, including PFIs |\n\n| **Output 3:** Capacity-building of PFIs to promote both men and women potential sub-borrowers' access to the GEFF credit lines | | | |\n\nBased on the results of the baseline assessment:\n• Deliver one presentation to PFIs senior management;\n• Produce one gender training session, and train at least 20 staff in each assisted PFI in critical functions for the adoption and delivery of programme finance;\n• Organise a study tour for up to 20 PFI staff (1 or 2 per programme country) to exchange knowledge and lessons learned from implementing the gender programme | • Number of PFI staff trained in line with the gender training module;\n• Number of seminars to PFIs senior management to promote women's access to GEFF credit lines;\n• Ex-ante and ex-post survey among PFI staff to measure their increased understanding of gender issues\n• Databases created that include number and type of programme sub-borrowers (disaggregated by gender; loan amount; sector; if possible rural/urban area; residential / commercial use) | On a rolling basis, where applicable, as sub-projects come through | EBRD Consultant, in collaboration with PFI staff |\n\n| **Output 4:** Lessons learnt and case studies to be disseminated through the appropriate knowledge products | | | |\n\n• Develop appropriate knowledge products (completion report and associated print and multimedia products, such as videos, flyers etc.) compiling and presenting lessons learnt and case studies from implementing PFIs and associated EBRD staff. | • Each country-level programme generates one brief knowledge product highlighting lessons learnt and case studies in the area of men and women's access to finance for climate technologies and recommendations / outcomes that also contribute to closing gender gaps\n• At least 10 multimedia products developed and disseminated both internally with the clients and externally at workshops/online | On a rolling basis, where applicable, as sub-projects come through | EBRD Consultant with support from local stakeholders, including PFIs |",
